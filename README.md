### 🛠️ OOP Branch

* 📅 26/06/25 (Thu) – Day 1 – Coding Review
Problem Statement : 📚 BookBuddy – Digital Bookshelf App
📝 Story:
Users maintain a personal digital bookshelf by adding, updating, and sorting their favorite books by title and author.

* ✅ Requirements:
Use an ArrayList<String> to store book titles in "Title - Author" format.

🔧 Methods:
* addBook(String title, String author)
* sortBooksAlphabetically()
* searchByAuthor(String author)

🔍 Functionality:
* Use String.split() to separate title and author.
* Convert the ArrayList to an array before exporting.

⚠️ Exception Handling:
* Throw InvalidBookFormatException if input string is not in the correct format.
* Handle cases when the list is empty using try-catch.
🔗 [Coming soon]()

* 📅 27/06/25 (Fri) – Day 2 – Coding Review
Problem Statement : 🧠 Online Quiz Platform – Result Processor
📘 Scenario:
A quiz platform processes user-submitted answers and compares them to the correct answers to calculate scores and assign grades.

✅ Problem Requirements:
* Use String[] arrays for:
* correctAnswers
* userAnswers

🔧 Functional Methods:
* Compare answers between user and correct answers.
* Calculate total score.
* Return grade based on the score.

📊 Data Handling:
Store scores of multiple users in a List<Integer>.

⚠️ Validation & Exception Handling:
* Validate if the length of userAnswers and correctAnswers match.
* Throw custom exception: InvalidQuizSubmissionException for mismatch.
